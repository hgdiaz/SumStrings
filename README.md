# SumStrings
It's a simple exersice I saw someone asking in a job interview

The idea is adding 2 numbers that are stored in strings and showing the complete result number, not in scientific notation. 

Seems quite simple if you have small numbers and you can convert them to Int or Bigint.

But what about having numbers like "999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999" ?

So, if you add just 1, the output result should be "1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000".
